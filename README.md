# Husarion-Rosbot-2022

This is all of the files currently on the Husarion ROSbot 2.0 Pro in the DeepSpace Lab.

Most of these files come from following the [Husarion Tutorials for ROS](https://husarion.com/tutorials/ros-tutorials/1-ros-introduction/). There are slight changes due to programming improvements.

## Ros_workspace

This should be all of the functioning code on the rosbot workspace. It heavily follows the tutorial. In order to port over, simply clone the repository and make using catkin_make.

## Sensors
This is additional code written to interact with the sensors on board the rosbot (INA 219 and 260).
